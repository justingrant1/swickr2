# Swickr Notification Performance Monitoring Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to use Swickr's notification performance monitoring system to track, analyze, and optimize push notification delivery and engagement.

## Overview

Swickr's notification performance monitoring system allows you to:

- Track notification delivery success rates and timing
- Monitor user engagement with notifications
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Analyze notification effectiveness by type
- Visualize performance trends over time

## Accessing the Performance Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Settings** to see a summary of notification performance metrics
2. Click on **Notification Performance** in the Application settings section for detailed metrics
3. The dashboard is accessible to all users, with additional admin features for system administrators

## Understanding the Dashboard

The notification performance dashboard provides the following information:

### Summary Cards
- **Total Notifications**: Count of notifications sent
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of notifications successfully delivered
- **Average Time**: Average delivery time in milliseconds
- **Click Rate**: Percentage of notifications clicked by users

### Performance Charts
- **Success Rate Trend**: Chart showing delivery success rate over time
- **Delivery Time Trend**: Chart showing average delivery time over time
- **Engagement Metrics**: Charts showing user interaction with notifications

### Detailed Metrics
- **Notification Types**: Performance breakdown by notification type
- **Failure Reasons**: Analysis of common delivery failures
- **Client Interactions**: Metrics on how users interact with notifications

## Testing Notification Performance

### Using the Test Script

The system includes a test script that allows you to send test notifications and measure performance:

```bash
# Basic test - sends 10 notifications with 500ms delay
node server/src/scripts/test-notification-performance.js

# Custom test - specify count and delay
node server/src/scripts/test-notification-performance.js 20 1000

# Test with client-side event simulation
node server/src/scripts/test-notification-performance.js 10 500 simulate-client
```

### Test Parameters

- **count**: Number of notifications to send (default: 10)
- **delay**: Delay between notifications in ms (default: 500)
- **simulate-client**: Whether to simulate client-side events (default: false)

### Test Results

The test script outputs detailed performance metrics:

```
========== PERFORMANCE TEST RESULTS ==========
Total notifications sent: 10
Successful: 9 (90.00%)
Failed: 1
Total duration: 5243ms
Average time per notification: 524.30ms

Client events simulated: 9
Click rate: 77.78%
Average interaction delay: 1834.56ms

========== PERFORMANCE METRICS ==========
Average send time: 487.33ms
Success rate: 90.00%
Min duration: 312ms
Max duration: 876ms
```

## Optimizing Notification Performance

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Payloads Small**: Limit notification content to essential information
   - Recommended payload size: < 4KB
   - Use media URLs instead of embedding images

2. **Batch Notifications**: Group related notifications when possible
   - Use summary notifications for multiple events
   - Avoid sending multiple notifications in quick succession

3. **Time Notifications Appropriately**: Send at optimal times
   - Consider user time zones
   - Analyze engagement patterns to determine best delivery times

4. **Prioritize Important Notifications**: Use priority levels
   - High priority: Time-sensitive alerts
   - Normal priority: Standard updates
   - Low priority: Marketing or non-urgent information

5. **Implement Retry Logic**: Handle delivery failures gracefully
   - Configure automatic retries for failed notifications
   - Use exponential backoff for retry attempts

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### High Failure Rate

If you notice a high notification failure rate:

1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify VAPID keys are properly configured
3. Ensure user subscriptions are valid and not expired
4. Check for service worker registration issues

### Slow Delivery Times

If notifications are taking too long to deliver:

1. Reduce payload size
2. Check server load and scaling
3. Verify Redis performance
4. Consider geographic distribution of notification services

### Low Engagement

If users aren't interacting with notifications:

1. Review notification content and relevance
2. Check timing of notifications
3. Ensure notifications are properly formatted
4. Test different notification styles and content

## Advanced Features

### Custom Performance Reports

Generate custom performance reports using the API:

```javascript
// Example: Get performance metrics for a specific date range
const metrics = await axios.get('/api/notifications/performance', {
  params: {
    startDate: '2025-01-01',
    endDate: '2025-01-31',
    type: 'message'
  }
});
```

### Notification A/B Testing

Use performance metrics to conduct A/B testing:

1. Create notification variants with different content or timing
2. Send to different user segments
3. Compare engagement metrics in the performance dashboard
4. Implement the most effective approach
