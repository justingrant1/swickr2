## Performance Optimizations

Swickr is designed with performance as a core principle. We maintain strict performance targets:
- Message latency: < 500ms from send to receipt
- App launch time: < 2s on modern devices

### Encrypted Presence Features

Our encrypted presence features (typing indicators, read receipts, and online status) use the following optimizations to maintain performance while ensuring privacy:

#### Web Worker Implementation

Encryption operations are offloaded to a dedicated Web Worker thread to prevent UI blocking:

```javascript
// Example: Using the worker service for encryption
const encryptedData = await workerService.encryptWithWorker(
  messageContent,
  recipientKeys
);
```

Benefits:
- Keeps the UI responsive during heavy encryption tasks
- Allows parallel processing of multiple encryption operations
- Gracefully falls back to main thread when Web Workers aren't supported

#### Smart Caching

We implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for encrypted presence data:

```javascript
// Example: Using the performance service for cached operations
const result = await performanceService.cacheOperation(
  cacheKey,
  async () => await expensiveOperation()
);
```

This reduces redundant encryption operations for frequently accessed data.

#### Batching and Debouncing

Multiple presence updates are batched together to reduce network traffic and encryption overhead:

```javascript
// Example: Batching multiple operations
await performanceService.batchOperation(
  'presenceUpdates',
  updateData,
  async (batch) => await processBatch(batch)
);
```

Typing indicators are debounced to prevent excessive updates during rapid typing.

#### Real-time Performance Monitoring

The `PerformanceMonitor` component provides real-time visibility into:
- Message latency
- Encryption time
- Cache hit rates
- Batch processing efficiency

Users can toggle specific optimizations based on their device capabilities and preferences.

#### Adaptive Settings

Performance settings automatically adjust based on device capabilities:
- Reduced batch sizes on low-end devices
- Increased cache limits on high-memory devices
- Adjusted debounce intervals based on network conditions

These optimizations ensure that Swickr's encrypted presence features maintain the application's performance targets while providing strong privacy guarantees.

## Performance Monitoring

Swickr includes a comprehensive performance monitoring system to ensure encrypted presence features maintain optimal performance:

```javascript
// Access the performance dashboard
import { PerformanceDashboard } from './components/performance';

// Example: Render the performance dashboard
<PerformanceDashboard />
```

The performance monitoring system includes:

1. **Performance Dashboard**: A central hub for all performance metrics with the following panels:
   - Overview panel for general performance metrics
   - Real-time metrics panel with time-series visualization
   - Encrypted presence panel for end-to-end encryption performance
   - Optimization comparison panel to evaluate different strategies
   - Worker, cache, batch, and network performance panels

2. **Real-time Metrics**: Live monitoring of key performance indicators:
   - Presence latency (target: <500ms)
   - Message latency
   - Updates per second
   - Cache hit rates
   - Worker utilization

3. **Optimization Strategies**: Compare different optimization approaches:
   - No optimization (baseline)
   - Cache-only optimization
   - Worker-only optimization
   - Batch-only optimization
   - Combined optimizations

4. **Performance Service API**:

```javascript
// Get general performance metrics
const metrics = performanceService.getMetrics();

// Get specific metrics for encrypted presence
const networkMetrics = performanceService.getNetworkMetrics();
const cacheMetrics = performanceService.getCacheMetrics();
const batchMetrics = performanceService.getBatchMetrics();
const workerMetrics = performanceService.getWorkerMetrics();

// Compare optimization strategies
const comparison = performanceService.getOptimizationComparison('latency');

// Get optimization recommendations
const recommendations = performanceService.getOptimizationRecommendations();

// Update performance configuration
performanceService.updateConfig({
  useWorker: true,
  useCache: true,
  useBatch: true,
  batchSize: 10,
  cacheSize: 100
