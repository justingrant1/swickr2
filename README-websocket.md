# Swickr WebSocket Integration

## Overview

This document provides a quick overview of the WebSocket integration in Swickr, highlighting the real-time messaging features implemented and how to test them.

## Features Implemented

- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are delivered instantly to all participants in a conversation
- **Typing Indicators**: Users can see when others are typing in a conversation
- **Read Receipts**: Users can see when their messages have been read
- **User Status Updates**: Users can see when their contacts are online, away, or offline
- **Conversation Management**: Users can join and leave conversations in real-time

## Architecture

Swickr's WebSocket implementation uses:

- **Socket.IO** for real-time bidirectional communication
- **JWT Authentication** for secure WebSocket connections
- **React Context API** for state management on the client
- **Node.js with Express** for the server

## Key Components

### Server-Side

- `server/src/websocket/socket.js`: WebSocket server implementation
- `server/src/services/socketService.js`: Service for managing WebSocket connections and events
- `server/src/services/messageService.js`: Service for handling messages, integrated with WebSockets

### Client-Side

- `client/src/services/socketService.js`: Client service for WebSocket communication
- `client/src/services/messageService.js`: Client service for message handling
- `client/src/context/MessagingContext.js`: React context for managing messaging state

## Testing

Two test scripts are provided to verify the WebSocket functionality:

1. **Server-side test**: `server/src/scripts/testWebSocketIntegration.js`
   - Tests WebSocket connection, authentication, and event handling
   - Simulates two users exchanging messages and other events

2. **Client-side test**: `client/src/tests/websocketIntegration.test.js`
   - Tests client-side WebSocket integration with React components
   - Verifies that the UI updates correctly in response to WebSocket events

### Running the Tests

To run the server-side test:

```bash
cd server
npm run test:websocket
```

To run the client-side test:

```bash
cd client
npm test -- -t "WebSocket Integration"
```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on the WebSocket integration, see:

- `docs/websocket-integration.md`: Comprehensive documentation of the WebSocket implementation

## Performance

The WebSocket integration is designed to meet Swickr's performance targets:

- Message latency under 500ms
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Efficient message delivery to multiple recipients

## Brand Identity

The WebSocket integration follows Swickr's brand identity:

- Focus on speed and simplicity
- Minimalist design with focus on content
- Instant visual feedback for all actions

## Next Steps

1. **Media Sharing**: Implement file upload functionality for sharing images, videos, and documents
2. **Group Conversations**: Enhance WebSocket functionality for group conversations
3. **Message Reactions**: Add support for message reactions and replies
4. **End-to-End Encryption**: Implement end-to-end encryption for messages
5. **Voice and Video Calls**: Integrate WebRTC for voice and video communication
